# Unsupervised Learning with Cryptocurrencies

## Description

The Unsupervised Learning with Cryptocurrencies notebook is a sample notebook that illustrates how to apply unsupervised learning techniques such as the KMeans technique, the Elbow Method and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to cluster data so that we can find relationships.   In this notebook, we will import a CSV file containing a list of cryptocurrencies along with their price changes for different periods.   We will then use the KMeans algorithm to segment the data and then display the data in a scatter plot for further analysis.

## Technologies

This example uses the following technologies:

- **Jupyter** - Jupyter is a web-based interactive development environment for data science and analysis. Please see [Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter.org/) for more information.
- **pandas** - pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. Please see [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for more information.
- **Scikit-Learn** - Scikit-Learn is an open-source machhine learning library for the Python programming language.  Please see [Scikit-Learn documentation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scikit_learn/scikit_learn_introduction.htm) for more information.

## Installation

## Usage

### Launching the Notebook

To launch the Notebook, perform the following steps:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Navigate to the location of the Notebook.
3. Enter `jupyter lab` at the Terminal prompt.
4. Verify that you can access Jupyter in your browser.

Once you have launched the notebook, you can then execute each section.

1. Import the Data and Prepare the Data
2. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
4. Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
5. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
6. Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
7. Visualize and Compare the Results
